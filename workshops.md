## Available Workshops

### Causal AI Workshop

Learn practical applications of causal inference in machine learning. This workshop covers causal reasoning, causal discovery, and how to integrate causal thinking into your ML workflows.

**Resources:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/altdeep/causalml)

### Probabilistic Machine Learning Workshop

Explore probabilistic modeling techniques and their connection to Bayesian methods. This workshop provides a code-first experience with Pytorch.

**Resources:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/altdeep/probmodeler)

## Workshop Format

These workshops are currently offered **in-person only**. They were previously available as online remote workshops through [Altdeep.ai](https://altdeep.ai), but are now exclusively conducted in-person to provide a more interactive and engaging learning experience.
