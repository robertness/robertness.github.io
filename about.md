<img id="profilePic" src="https://robertness.github.io/assets/images/profile.png" align="left" style="padding:5px;">  I use machine learning and stochastic simulation to model molecular biology. I am particularly interested in causal inference with Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming. I also do tons of R development.  [See more background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osazuwa).
