<img id="profilePic" src="https://robertness.github.io/assets/images/profile.png" align="left" style="padding:5px;">  I am interested in model-based approaches to machine learning problems, i.e., starting by explicitly building assumptions about the problem domain into a model, and iteratively updating the model with new data and expert feedback.  My dissertation research focused on applying methods from Bayesian inference, graphical modeling, and causal inference to systems biology.

Some of my work on those topics:

* Ness, R. O., Sachs, K., Mallick, P. & Vitek, O. (2016). A Bayesian active learning experimental design for inferring signaling networks.  Preprint. [pdf](https://robertness.github.io/assets/manuscripts/bayes_active_learning.pdf)
* Ness, R. O., Sachs, K., & Vitek, O. (2016). From correlation to causality: statistical approaches to learning regulatory relationships in large-scale biomolecular investigations. Journal of Proteome Research, 15. [html](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00911) 

I do lots of development in R, and probabilistic programming languages like Stan.  My hobbies include being a nootropics nerd, classical Chinese, and keyboard rhythm games.  [See more background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osazuwa).
